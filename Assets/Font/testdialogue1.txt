There you are! After all this running, I found you!
#speaker:The BlackCat
Ah, yes. I was being followed.
#speaker:???
Woah, you talk!
#speaker:The Black Cat
Human, you must traverse through these doors if you wish to return to where you belong.
#speaker:???
Where I belong...?
But where am I, o mysterious feline?
#speaker:Cat
...
Meow.
#speaker:???
Hey! You can't just stop talking to me when I ask you a question!!
#speaker:Cat
Do you even know your own name, child?
#speaker:???
My name? Of course! It's....
...
I... don't know.
#speaker:The Black Cat
I see.
I apologize, human. There is only so much information that I can disclose.
If you really do want answers, seek out The Novaturient.  She owns this domain, and I am but her humble denizen.
However, the door to her chambers is locked.
Only with the five worldly gems can you enter.
#speaker:???
How can I get these gems then?
#speaker:The Black Cat
By entering their respective portals, of course.
But if I remember right, The Novaturient broke all the gems when she was upset with me the other day.
#speaker:???
Eeeeehhhh??????
#speaker:The Black Cat
I am no longer allowed in her room, you see.
...I kept throwing up hairballs in her bed..
#speaker:???
That's... disgusting.
#speaker:The Black Cat
Meow.
Worry not, human. The shards still remain in each world.
If you collect them all, they should return to their original forms.
The Novaturient hid them though.  Where I do not know.
#speaker:???
Do you have any ideas?
#speaker:The Black Cat
I've noticed that there are items that do not belong in each world. Some stand out more than others, but belong they do not.
Come closer, human.
